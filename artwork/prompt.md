A 3D-rendered vintage ribbon microphone icon for an iOS app. The microphone has a classic retro design with metallic chrome and silver details, soft studio lighting, and subtle reflections. Set against a smooth gradient background transitioning from deep royal blue to a lighter sky blue. The icon follows Apple's iOS 26 design language with rounded super-ellipse shape, soft depth and shadows, and a clean, modern aesthetic. The microphone is centered and slightly angled for dimension. No text, no extra elements — just the mic on the gradient. A square image that I can use to generate macOS icons.
